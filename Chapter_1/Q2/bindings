Q. From ghci, type :? to print some help. Define a variable, such as let x = 1 and then type : show bindings. What do you see?

Prelude> let x = 1
x :: Integer
Prelude> :show bindings
it :: Integer = 4
x :: Integer = 1

Note:
:show bindings command is used to show the current bindings made at the prompt.
